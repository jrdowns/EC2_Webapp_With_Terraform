## Terraform Steps
### `terraform init`
The terraform init command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This command performs several different initialization steps in order to prepare the current working directory for use with Terraform. During init, the configuration is searched for module blocks, and the source code for referenced modules is retrieved from the locations given in their source arguments.

### `terraform plan`
The terraform plan command creates an execution plan, which lets you preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure. You can save the plan to a binary file for execution later with `terraform plan -out <file name>`. You can save a terraform plan as JSON with `terraform show -json <file name>`

### `terraform apply`
The terraform apply command executes the actions proposed in a Terraform plan. When you run terraform apply without passing a saved plan file, Terraform automatically creates a new execution plan as if you had run terraform plan, prompts you to approve that plan, and takes the indicated actions.

### `terraform destroy`
The terraform destroy command is a convenient way to destroy all remote objects managed by a particular Terraform configuration. Since this is just for pratice, I'll destroy the environment after it's been created.

## Init
First, I'll initialize the working directory with `terraform init`

## Plan
Next, we'll check to make sure Terraform is going to do everything we expect by running `terraform plan`. Be careful if you save the output to a file, it will expose any keys that are referenced in the Terraform files.

## Apply
If the changes look good, I'll go ahead and apply them with `terraform apply`. This will build our resources in AWS. For the apply to proceed, you have to confirm the action by typing "yes" when prompted.
